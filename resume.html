              <p class="mb-0">Software Designer and later Software Design Manager for custom feature development organization in the DMS-250 and DMS-500 digital telephone switches in the public and government markets. Software Support Engineer for the DMS-250 long-distance markets. These roles utilized Waterfall and later an early form of Agile methodology, combining a phased approach to project management with planned process checkpoints to emphasize collaboration and continuous improvement.</p>
              
                <ul>
                  
                    <li>Protel/C programming in a Unix environment on HP Xterminals with more than 20,000 lines of code written.</li>
                  
                    <li>Full feature development including specification, documentation, testing, and releases in PEP phases (similar to Sprints in Agile).</li>
                  
                    <li>Lab Testing using manual and automated test suites on the Digital Test Head platform (Similar to Jenkins for website testing with customizable, community-driven test modules to allow customized test environments for all product groups and developments).</li>
                  
                    <li>Co-developed a hybrid local/long-distance software combination via unique code restructuring and new core process management.</li>
                  
                    <li>Proven ability to attract/retain top talent, mentor employees, and advise management on policy-related matters.</li>
                  
                    <li>Creation of the Product Enhancement Patch Process. Up to 1995, the method for all software development was the waterfall method where a series of software features were developed and bundled into one large release. My PEP methodology was to take a large feature or group of feature components and break them into smaller, quickly releasable PEP Units, similar to Sprints in the Agile methodology that came 5 years later.</li>
                  
                    <li>Creation of the DMS-500 Local/Long Distance Hybrid: The PEP process introduced a large complexity to the test phase of product releases. It needed a greater level of flexibility in testing than the current Digital Test Head could do through a linear test model approach. I co-led a team to merge the DMS-100 Local telephone operating system with the DMS-250 Long-distance telephone operating system, to merge two products into one. This allowed for 3-dimensional testing of end-to-end call viability using the DTH as the call controller and the new DMS-500 to make local-long distance-local call mixtures. When the device proved functional at over 1 million call attempts per hour, we were able to make it an official product for the company and open the door to small full-service telephone companies.</li>
