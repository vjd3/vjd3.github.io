# Penetration Testing vs. Red Teaming?

***How does penetration testing differ from engaging a red team? Although there are similarities, like both are forms of Ethical Hacking, they are not the same.***

With regards to running security assessments, organizations frequently treat penetration testing and red teaming as though they are the same thing - they're not. The initial step to picking the right security assessment for your organization starts with understanding the differences between penetration testing and red teaming.

### What is penetration testing?
A penetration test, colloquially known as a pentest or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system; this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify weaknesses (or vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data. Pen testers then exploit those vulnerabilities to determine the risk of the vulnerabilities.

Pen testers are trying to find already known (fix available) but unpatched system vulnerabilities. During a typical pen test, pen testers try to find a version of installed software that is known to be vulnerable and then exploit that vulnerability. As they go through this process, finding vulnerable versions of software and building potential exploits, they make a plan to reach their end goal through some combination of available exploits. These goals will culminate in an analysis of exploitable software and recommendations for moving forward. They will also identify the areas of the network that were vulnerable and the associated data. Using this form of testing is crucial in evaluating the risk to an organization.

### What is red teaming?
Red teaming shares many similarities with pen testing; however, the goals are different. Red teaming is more scenario-driven than pen testing. The goal of a red team engagement is not just to test the systems in place, but also the people and processes of the organization as well. Red teams work for the organization or are hired by the organization. Their work is legal, but can surprise some employees who may not know that red teaming is occurring, or who may be deceived by the red team. 

A common technical red team scenario may include exploiting lost laptops, connecting unauthorized devices to an internal network and compromised DMZ hosts, as well as testing how the security operations center, or blue team, reacts to an advanced persistent threat. Will the SOC or blue team defenders notice when an employee is exfiltrating data from the network?
Technical red teaming involves testing the digital security of an organization by attempting to infiltrate its computer networks digitally. Physical red teaming focuses on sending a team to gain entry to restricted areas. This is done to test and optimize physical security such as fences, cameras, alarms, locks, and employee behavior. 

Red teams may use a variety of scenario-driven testing for the evaluation of a business's ability to detect and manage external threats. Some examples are phishing campaigns, social engineering attempts, attempts to gain physical access to the site, website compromise assessments, protection software evasion, lateral movement across networks, and many other attacks, depending on the complexity of an organization's systems.

### Penetration testing vs. red teaming: One, the other, or both?
Penetration Testing and Red Teaming are tools to be used to reach specific goals. If the goal is to test systems and networks for known vulnerabilities, especially to determine if those vulnerabilities can be exploited, then a pen test would be the best way to go. If the goal is to learn more about the security posture of your organization and its ability to react to specific threats, then a red team engagement would be the best choice. Eventually, both are used if an organization truly wants to understand the risks to their networks, systems, data and facilities.
