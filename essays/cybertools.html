Kali includes roughly 600 pre-installed programs or <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/all-tools/">tools</a>, each included to help computer security experts carry out a specific attack, probe or exploit against a target. Aircrack-ng, Metasploit , Nmap, Nikto, Sqlmap, and Wireshark are a few of the pre-installed tools that ship with the Kali Linux download.</p>

<h3 id="7-metasploit-framework-kali-free">7. Metasploit Framework (KALI) (FREE)</h3>
<p>The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is far more than just a collection of exploits–it is also a solid foundation that you can build upon and easily customize to meet your needs. MSF is one of the most useful security auditing tools freely available to security professionals today.</p>

<p>From a wide array of commercial grade exploits and an extensive exploit development environment, all the way to network information gathering tools and web vulnerability plugins, the Metasploit Framework can test computer system vulnerabilities or can be used to break into remote systems, used by both ethical hackers and criminal gangs to probe networks and applications for flaws and weaknesses. There is both a free and a Pro version and ships with more than 2,300 exploits and more than 3,300 modules and payloads to help users orchestrate well-planned attacks. <a href="https://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a> comes pre-installed on Kali Linux.</p>

<h3 id="8-nmap-kali-free">8. Nmap (KALI) (FREE)</h3>
<p><a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a> (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime, Nmap uses raw IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. While Nmap provides users immense power and capability to explore networks, the program has a rather steep learning curve to get over before one becomes truly proficient in using it.</p>

<h3 id="9-nikto-kali-free">9. Nikto (KALI) (FREE)</h3>
<p><a href="https://cirt.net/Nikto2">Nikto</a> is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated. Nikto is not designed as a stealthy tool. It will test a web server in the quickest time possible, and is obvious in log files or to an IPS/IDS. However, there is support for LibWhisker’s anti-IDS methods in case you want to give it a try (or test your IDS system).</p>

<h3 id="10-open-vulnerability-assessment-scanner-free">10. Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner (FREE)</h3>

<h3 id="12-p0f-free">12. P0f (FREE)</h3>
<p><a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/">P0f</a> is a steath tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive traffic fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any incidental TCP/IP communications without interfering in any way. Some of p0f’s capabilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Highly scalable and extremely fast identification of the OS and software on both endpoints of a vanilla TCP connection - especially in settings where NMap probes are blocked, too slow, unreliable, or would simply set off alarms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measurement of system uptime and network hookup, distance (including topology behind NAT or packet filters), user language preferences, and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automated detection of connection sharing / NAT, load balancing, and application-level proxying setups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detection of clients and servers that forge declarative statements such as X-Mailer or User-Agent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tool can be operated in the foreground or as a daemon, and offers a simple real-time API for third-party components that wish to obtain additional information about the actors they are talking to.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Common uses for p0f include reconnaissance during penetration tests; routine network monitoring; detection of unauthorized network interconnects in corporate environments; providing signals for abuse-prevention tools; and miscellanous forensics. Being passive rather than active means p0f is nearly impossible to detect and even harder to block, making it a favorite tool for ethical hackers and cybercriminals alike.</p>

<h3 id="18-veracrypt-free">18. VeraCrypt (FREE)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> is a free open source disk encryption software package. It runs on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux and creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file before mounting it as a real disk. On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted right before it is saved and decrypted right after it is loaded, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. Entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names, folder names, contents of every file, free space, meta data, etc).</p>

<p>Files can be copied to and from a mounted VeraCrypt volume just like they are copied to/from any normal disk (for example, by simple drag-and-drop operations). Files are automatically being decrypted on the fly (in memory/RAM) while they are being read or copied from an encrypted VeraCrypt volume. Similarly, files that are being written or copied to the VeraCrypt volume are automatically being encrypted on the fly (right before they are written to the disk) in RAM. Note that this does not mean that the whole file that is to be encrypted/decrypted must be stored in RAM before it can be encrypted/decrypted. There are no extra memory (RAM) requirements for VeraCrypt.</p>

<h3 id="19-wireshark-kali-free">19. Wireshark (KALI) (FREE)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> is considered by many to be the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer and an indispensable tool to locate, identify and examine network packets to diagnose critical issues and spot security weaknesses.
