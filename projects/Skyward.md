summary: "Conversion to a web based Student Information System provided by Skyward."
---

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/skyward/skywardsm1.jpg">

Skyward is a web application front end to a massive database that houses all family, student, class, course, grade, scheduling, and billing information.

This project involved project planning for 10 schools, owned by Meritas, with 10 different methods of managing all systems. The conversion began with vendor selection via a dozen RFPs managed by the Chicago office. Meetings with the core group included required feature lists from every school, including all teaching, parent, and administrative areas. Once Skyward was selected, conversions were planned by bringing in prime representatives from each school into multiple training and conversion training sessions that I ran in Chicago.

In this project, I acted as the primary project planner, trainer of each school's conversion plan, host of numerous training sessions for conversion and later initial usage, and finally host of the first annual Skyward conference.

As host of the Skyward conference, I put together classes, seminars, and guest speakers for a 3-day intensive networking and training event.
